            The Greater Melbourne Area is currently home to
            <strong>over 23,000 listings</strong> on Airbnb. Let's take a look
            at where they're located:

          <p class="description description-left justified-text">
            The <strong>City of Melbourne</strong> is both the most Airbnb-dense
            area, and the local council area with the most Airbnb listings. This
            is likely due to its central location and convenience for travellers
            using Airbnb. The <strong>City of Casey</strong> is the local
            council area with both the greatest number of dwellings and the
            lowest density of listings.

            In general, the areas closer to the Melbourne Central Business
            District (CBD) have a higher density of Airbnbs compared to those
            further away. However, despite being futher from the CBD, there is a
            high density of Airbnb listings in the
            <strong>Yarra Ranges</strong>, likely due to its popularity as a
            tourist destination.

              For most Local Council Areas, the most common type of room listed
              on airbnb is
              <span class="purple-text">entire homes and apartments</span>,
              making up <strong>72.8% of all listings</strong> in Greater
              Melbourne. <span class="pink-text">Private rooms</span> are often
              the second most common (<strong>25.6%</strong>), while
              <span class="green-text">shared rooms</span>
              (<strong>1.2%</strong>) and
              <span class="yellow-text">hotel rooms</span>
              (<strong>0.4%</strong>) are far less common. <br />
              <br />
              However, for some areas, such as <strong>Whittlesea</strong> and
              <strong>Greater Dandenong</strong>,
              <span class="pink-text">private rooms</span> are more common,
              making up <strong>56.98%</strong> and <strong>59.30%</strong> of

          <p class="justified-text">
            Airbnb listings vary greatly in terms of price, rating, number of
            rooms, and minimum length of your stay. Let's take a look at some of
            the common trends between the different listing types:

            Unsurprisingly, the numbers of <strong>bedrooms</strong>,
            <strong>beds</strong>, and <strong>bathrooms</strong> tend to
            correlate strongly with each other. Interestingly,
            <strong>rating</strong> tends to inversely proportional to
            <strong>price</strong>, meaning
            <strong>lower prices tend to get higher ratings</strong> and vice
            versa. This could be due to travellers feeling that they got better
            value for money in less expensive homestays.

            Across nearly all Local Council Areas,
            <span class="purple-text">entire homes and apartments</span> tend to
            have <strong>more bathrooms</strong>, <strong>more beds</strong>,
            <strong>more bathrooms</strong>, <strong>higher ratings</strong>,
            and therefore <strong>higher prices</strong> when compared to
            <span class="pink-text">private rooms</span>. Due to small sample
            sizes, it is difficult to make generalizations about
            <span class="green-text">shared rooms</span> and
